# team-profile-generator

# Employee Summary
# Description
For this project I was challeneged to build a Node CLI that could generate an HTML webpage containing an employee roster. The user could input as many team members as needed + assign  roles to them within the company (roles such as... managers, engineers, or interns). Once the user is finished inputting all employees, the entire team roster will populate.


# Usage

Start program by running node app after installing dependencies.

## Example of questions:

? What is the employee's name? 
? What is the employee's ID number? 
? What is the employee's work email address? 
? What is the employee's role? 
? What is the managers's office number? 
? Would you like to add another employee? (Y/n)

# Test
npm run test

# Installation
Inquirer and Jest are needed. Run npm i to install all dependencies.
